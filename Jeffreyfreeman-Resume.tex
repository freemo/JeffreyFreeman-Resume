\cventry{June 2006--September 2006}{Software Architect}{\textsc{FEMA}}{Virgina}{}{Developed \& Designed FEMA's most mission critical application called ADD, Automated Deployment Database. The purpose of the application was to manage the deployment of workers during a national disaster. The new software came from the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. At the core is a \textbf{decision engine} which suggested deployment schemes based on the conditions at hand. The project used \textbf{Oracle 92g} as the back end, and the \textbf{Ibatis} framework. Responsibilities included acting as senior developer on the project consisting of 5 other programmers as well as the being in charge of all \textbf{database} responsibilities, in particular writing all the \textbf{PL/SQL}. The front end used \textbf{Spring}, a \textbf{MVC framework}. The contract with the company was only for 3 months; Chose not to renew that contract.

\cventry{March 2005--June 2006}{Technical Lead}{\textsc{Freewebs, Inc. (now Webs, Inc.)}}{Silver Springs, MD}{}{This company was started by the old owners of WebOS, a previous employer. Primary responsibilities included design and implementation of \textbf{regression analysis} and \textbf{statistical analysis} software.
\newline{}\newline{}
One role in particular was \textbf{project lead} for the internal and external usage statistics and analysis software. The system utilized a large collection of \textbf{machine learning algorithms} to compute vital information about its users. This information would generate suggestions to improve traffic into specific areas of the site and provide deep analysis of what influences a users decisions. The project used a \textbf{PostgreSQL} database and later moved to \textbf{Oracle database}. The system had to process over 4 million records per hour in real time and produce in-depth \textbf{statistics} on the data. The entire application was written in \textbf{Java} using a \textbf{J2EE} webapp to display the results. It included an administration tool, also developed using \textbf{J2EE}. The daemon portion of the tool, responsible for injecting the statistics into the database, used \textbf{XML (JAXP/SAX)} configuration files. \textbf{Java-script} and \textbf{DHTML} was also used extensively on the front-end. All of which required the \textbf{deployment and management of Tomcat}.
\newline{}\newline{}
A supplementary role was as a \textbf{project lead} on a user survey system done in \textbf{Java} and \textbf{J2EE}. The system automatically generated surveys based on which questions in the database were most relevant to the individual. \textbf{Oracle} was used as the database back end.
